      "I think the worst food that would be liquefied and drank through a straw would be something meaty, because I don't think that would liquefy well. Like, I can't imagine eating drinking a steak, but maybe I'll feel about it differently when I'm old. I think that I can do almost anything better than 90% of the people, because as I look around me and I see the people and humanity and the actions of others, I feel that I'm just better than everyone else. The most amazing nature place that I've been to definitely has to be in Canada, maybe probably even Quebec have been going in the eastern townships and walking through the forest and seeing the different animals running around. There was really a great experience and I was really happy to be there when I was there. The next thing to be obsolete. Oh, it's hard to imagine. I try to see what's around me. Maybe motion capture, maybe data sets something to think about while we're doing this exercise. Hopefully not the technology we're developing right now. The most annoying animal in the animal kingdom, without a doubt, is the beaver, because it just chews on things and it creates dams and it stops water. It's just making a mess.\n",
      "I think there are certain services that are much more expensive than they should be, for sure. Anything that doesn't involve a human being I think should be less expensive. And one day I'm going to become an inventor and I'm going to charge nothing for all these services. I mean, someone to come in to your house and clean. There's already a vacuum that does that, you know, for nothing. The shadiest thing I've seen someone do is come into space where there's a lot of cameras around, get into a weird suit with little balls on them, and then somebody's asking them questions. I don't know where they were going with any of that. The other day I was walking home and it was night and there was a man and he was walking down and I say, got closer. I noticed that he was just covered in blood. So I didn't know what it was. So I got closer and I started talking to him and I was like, Hey, you know, blood, what's going on? And he said, Don't worry, I'm coming from a film set. And they were filming a horror movie and we became good friends. He's coming over for dinner tomorrow night, an iron smell. But apparently it's this new fake blood technology that they're developing. So because the next the future in filmmaking is going to be a smell, a vision. So they want to just that. He told me that he wanted to make sure that it smelled right. It no, it was and it was hard to identify because he was dressed all in black, a very handsome, and he just looked like a normal kind of guy.\n",
      "Last weekend was still a quiet weekend. I was at home. I spent some time with my family. I went swimming with with my kid. I have a kid. She's great. And she really likes swimming. She loves going into the swimming pool and feeling the weightlessness of the water. So the rule is that I have to. She's too young, my daughter's too young. So I have to go into the swimming pool with her, which is not great. So I've chosen just the best heated pool in the city. It's like 40 Celsius degrees Celsius. You go in and it's like soup and it's wonderful. I've gone to the beach with my daughter. She really likes it. There's a great beach here in in Ontario that you can go very, very, very far. So the likelihood of her drowning is very little, which I appreciate. It's something that it's good when a child doesn't drown in that beach. I find that something that I would look for. The last vacation I took and I'm going to talk about the real one because there's been a lot of vacations that don't count as vacations because we're not allowed to go anywhere. So the real vacation, the good vacation, I went to an island in Europe that's called Mult, and it's a wonderful island. There's a lot of great things. It's a mix of Italy and it's a mix of, you know, the African coast and the sort of the Middle East countries and their cuisine. Their main cuisine is British. That's the only bad thing I would say about it, how with all the opportunities of great food, why would they choose that? I they had and it wasn't even there's good British food. I don't want to, you know, disrespect all British food because there's some good things, but all the good things of British food seem to come from like Indian, you know, this was like boiled meat.\n",
      "The oldest friend I have is someone I met in my childhood when I was in Venezuela. I grew up in Venezuela and we met. We were very young. I don't remember meeting him, but people tell us how we met and apparently he was crying in the corner. Nobody would talk to him. He wasn't. He's not a great looking person. I love him. He's my best friend and I've known him for a lot. But he has felt like a hunchback. And he has he's you know, he's a homely kind of person, but a wonderful kind person. And I think that, you know, as a child, I sensed it and they went to see him and they said, let's be friends. And that was the beginning of it. It's been 60 years. Oh, it was an in another life, I meant to say, is so we don't he's far and you know, we can't really see anybody these days but I see my friend through cameras, virtual cameras, and in my dreams, he comes often. I am dreaming and I see him and we talk about all great things. He tells me which stock to buy, he all these great things. So it's nice to see him at night when I when I go to sleep. So he he recommends a varied stocks. He's he's not great. I mean, you know, I'm getting paid to come here. I wouldn't come if he had recommended great stock. I would have, you know, been off enjoying my wealth. But I still trust him. I think that it's going to pay off eventually. So I keep on taking his advice, selling when he says to sell, I buy when he says to buy. And I'm sure one day it will pay off. He's very rich. He has a private jet. And my friend, he he travels the world and he sees all great things. But sometimes it's, you know, he does things that we don't talk about that because he does things that I think that I would not approve of. What you know. But it's his life. And I say live and let live.\n",
      "Dreams can be particular in that some of them can seem perfectly normal. We fall had kind of dreams where you're falling or when you're scared. We've had all these kinds of dreams that make us feel all sorts of great things. But some we dream dreams are just weird. They're strange, and you're not sure what's happening. You're walking in, you're in your underwear, and so is everybody. And sometimes there's trees that talk and, you know, could be very strange. So I don't remember all of my dreams, but I would say that I've had some very strange dreams. Not the one where my friend talked to me. Those are normal and good and they make me feel happy. And but sometimes they can be really strange and not good. The worst nightmare that I've ever had, I'm afraid to tell you, because it's very scary. And I don't know if I want to scare you. Are you okay? Is it okay if I scare you? So it's very dark and there's nobody and a light turns on. And the light shows me and I try to hide, but I'm hiding behind a piece of glass and everybody can see it. And I can't hide. And I'm running and I'm running. And I'm very scared. And then I realize that I'm alone. And it doesn't matter if anybody sees me because there's nothing to do. I'm just by myself. And then I wake up and I see that it's just true. I wasn't dreaming. It was just what was happening all the time. I was in my bed alone in the dark. But, you know, that's not so bad. You could be with someone horrible, too. And they, you know, the dream that I had. I wish it would come true. It's a dream where I'm flying and you're going through the air and it feels so good. And you just feel like you can go anywhere and be anything. And it's it feels great. You feel free.\n",
      "How? Oh. The last time I was hopefully hopelessly lost. I think the real question is when are we not hopelessly lost? Uh, if I could have the smart version of something, I think her company should make a smart. So difficult. I don't know what to answer. I'm too sad. The end of The Lion King. It's really upsetting. So he comes back after his father look for it. But he's dead. And then, you know, because he falls in love with him. But, you know, the two lions are getting divorced. You just know it's not going to work out. Simba is not going to be a good father. Oh, I'm a I'm someone clumsy by nature. I have done a lot of clumsy things. So I think the clumsiest thing I have ever done is tripped and fallen. And I was too sad to get up. I think that it's very strange and people accept this normal to be happy. There is no reason to be happy. Look around. Everything around us is gray and sad.\n",
      "I once tried to save an animal who was a puppy, and the puppy was stuck in some mud and it was trying so hard. Doug and Doug and crawled. But the mud, it was just giving in and it was just digging itself deeper and deeper. And I went and I. I picked them up, but it beat me, so I had to walk away and leave the puppy in the mud. I got rabies after the puppy bit me in the mud. And then I went to the doctor. I don't know if you've had rabies, but it's not fun to have rabies. You have to get a shot and you have to stay in the hospital and sleep there. I spend 20 days in the hospital and nobody came to see me. Nobody said the flowers thought to include the puppy died. I don't know. Nobody comes. Visit me. I think I'm funny and I tell jokes. Sometimes people don't love when I tell the jokes, but I try to make friends. Maybe it's just because nobody's smart or funny. There was a time that everybody died. Everybody. All the families. Oh, everybody was. It was. It wasn't the best time. But it didn't change anything in the end. I'm used to being alone with no one around, So I guess that I was ready for the moment. I was prepared, but it didn't help.\n",
      "Some people think that war is good and that conflict can only lead to resolution. But war can also be very sad. Once I was in a field with my buddy, the soldiers. It was a gruesome battle. Many died. We were walking around thinking about life and death. But then something happened. My friend slipped on some guts and fell. We laughed and we cried. And to me, that's what war is about. Slipping on guts. If you have to go to war. Only if you have to. You should not want to go to war. You should eat a lot before. Because there's not a lot of food in the battles. If you've gone to different battles, you should know that you're not going to eat a lot. You're going to be very, very hungry. You're going to want to eat. And you can't. Finally, after all the battles and slipping on guts, I came back and, you know what? There was nothing waiting for me. I thought I came back. I opened my house and my wife, she was gone. And my husband, he was gone. My children, they were gone. And my grandchildren, they were gone. And you know the saddest part. The strangest. Anita, I need a moment was that they left the day after I left. They didn't even wait for it, though. If I. If I died, they could have waited until I died.\n",
      "You might think I'm a normal person like you. Like me. But I have a normal talent. A normal talent. No, that's not right. I'm sorry. I have a very weird, weird talent. I can make anybody laugh. Just. I don't know. But if someone's very sad and they don't want to live any more, I can see them. And I can make them laugh All my life. All my life. Sometimes I can make people laugh intentionally. You might not believe, but I tell the stick jokes. Great. Great jokes. Other times it's not intentional. Sometimes people, they laugh at me. It's difficult to think what your biggest failure is. My mother tells me it's me that I am my own biggest failure from everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet. That there is nothing, nothing. Good. Just failure. Failure. Failure.\n",
      "I take it? I took my phone all the time. I hope that somebody has reached out, that somebody called me. So I sit in a room in the dark with the only light that's coming is from my phone. I say refresh to see if somebody, anybody sent a message. How are you? Are you doing okay? But it doesn't come up. Nobody writes. Nobody seems to care. I didn't get a letter. I got a letter. I went. I walked to my mailbox. I went and I. I opened the door and I looked. And there was a letter. I opened the envelope and they read it. And it was my cousin, my wonderful, wonderful cousin whom I haven't seen a very long, long time. And he was asking for money. He's very poor. He lives in a land far away where there's many animals, there's elephants and polar bears. And there he lives in a hut. He doesn't need much. But apparently he needed a little money.\n",
      "Oh, the movie that influence. There's so many movies that I love. I love going to the movies and seeing friends and being together. It's so exciting. But there is there is one movie that influenced me the most of all of them. You'll never guess what it is. Could you guess? I don't know if you. Okay. Okay. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. The movie that I love the most is Schindler's List. It's just. It's so great and so moving and you learn so much that I went and I saw it with my friends that we all had it just a wonderful time. We had a really great time. I have a pretty and I love my pretty red dress. I go to my closet and I choose and I see all the wonderful clothing I have and I see Annette going through it and I pick it out and I grab it and I put it on and it looks so great. I can dance with it. I can skip with it, and it just makes me feel happy and great. In in some movie you mentioned, I'm sure you know that movie. I didn't I didn't understand what you said, but I'm sure that movie is wonderful because. Oh, movies are great. How could you not like a movie? The most exciting place to watch a movie. It's the one theater that you go and there's stars in the ceiling and you sit down and you feel like you're outside, but you're not at sight. It's just suddenly lucid and you sit and you feel like you're one with nature, but you're not cold. There's no bugs. It's so great. The last movie that I saw in this theater was a great movie. I don't remember the name. I don't. But that's okay because I remember what happened. And it was a story about a kitten and it was a story about a little puppy. And they were friends and they ran around and some things happened that weren't great, but they got through it because they had great spirit.\n",
      "The best sitcom I saw. It's one I think that you'll think it's really funny and it just makes you feel so good. It's Arrested Development. It's a great series with so many quirky characters that just I see it and I want to sing and I want to dance. And it's so much fun. My favorite Broadway show is My Fair Lady, about a lady that she's poor and through hard work and determination and of course, with a lot of help from all her friends, she's able to become pretty and successful and find a husband. The best feature about her husband is that he speaks very good English. He teaches her how to pronounce every word, and he makes her work very hard. Because in this world, if you want anything, if you really want to succeed and become something wonderful, you have to work hard. You have to be positive. It's all about having a really positive attitude. The best way to get a positive attitude, you have to look around you in the world and see all the great things that are happening around you. The little flower growing in the spring, the rays of sunlight coming after the rain. The world is such an inspiring, wonderful place. I'm just so excited to live here and to be able to see everything that's around us. On a sunny day, I put on my red dress, I go out, it's swishes as I move along and I skip out into the field and sometimes I see people that aren't doing so well and they're looking sad. And I tell them, Look up, have a positive attitude and a smile on your face and everything will be well again.\n",
      "The phone is a wonderful machine and it's new and you can have lots of different phones. You can have like old time. Before that, you had to be like, Hello, how are you? And you had something in your ear and you had to talk into it. But it wasn't very good. People couldn't hear you and it evolved and it became something. And then you had to turn to Rotary and it was wonderful because you had to wait. Sometimes people had numbers that had a lot of zeros and you had to wait and wait, and you could think about all the wonderful things that were happening while you waited to call that one person. And it was so worth it because they were special and wonderful, and now they're just little things that come. And the best app is called The Happy Shop. And it's an app that you put and it tells you all the great things that you need. There's an app that tells you jokes and it tells you, Oh, wonderful scented flashes like bright colors in your face that makes you feel really good and see weird things around you. So it's just really great. The best person to call with my phone is this new app that's also really great. And it calls everybody at once and you everybody picks up their phone and they say, Hello, hello, who's there? And I was like, It's it's me. And they're all so excited and happy that it's me. And some of them really angry because I use it a lot and they call everybody a lot. And you think that everyone, you know, would be really happy, but they don't appreciate so much. But I know that they're just being grumpy dumb bees because there's no reason not to be happy. When I meet someone for the first time, I want to make sure that they're feeling good. So I'll put a big smile on my face. And sometimes people think that's strange and they look at me funny. But I just love. I just laugh and tell them that it's going to be wonderful. And then sometimes they walk away and they're like, I don't want to have anything to do with you. But I was like, That's okay. If this person, they're going to change their mind, then I'm going to just find someone totally different and we're going to be the best of friends.\n",
      "I love going to parties. Parties are so much fun and you get to see together. And the best one that I went was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Party, and there were trees that were made out of chocolate and there were bushes that were made out of cotton candy. I didn't feel so good at the end. I had I got sick and I threw up a lot. But it was worth it because we all had so much fun and it was magical place with so much wonderful colors. What's the coolest thing about diabetes? The coolest things about diabetes is that you might be sick and it's not great, but you can also get very healthy because if you know how to treat diabetes, you have to go running and you have to do all sorts of things to make you feel good and your body might not be able to deal with sugar, but it can. Sir, deal with positivity and good thoughts. My favorite candy is toffee, because you put it in your mouth and you chew it and you true it and it lasts for a super long time. To the people that don't like candy, you know what I say? I said, you can't eat fruit because fruit is nature's candy. It's full of good sugar, good things that go into your body and make you feel really good and give you lots of good energy and good energy. Nature. What gives you that's awesome is these chemicals that go into your brain that make you feel super happy so that you can go up to everybody and say, How are you today? You have a great day.\n",
      "When I was a child, I would grab I would go with my mom and my dad and my other dad and my other mom. And we would all go together to this wonderful restaurant. And I loved it because it was for adults and I was the kid and I was the only one that could go into the child's menu. And the child's menu was super special because it came with a toy. And the toy was anything you could imagine. I'm not kidding. You would imagine anything. And they would go in the back and they would bring you the toy that you wanted. It could you could have thought of anything. You know that Ghostbuster movie with the big marshmallow man, They got the idea for that movie from this restaurant. Can you believe my favorite restaurant? Now, you might not agree because some people look down on it and they say this is not a good restaurant. But I love McDonald's. I love to eat there morning, noon and night because they have all types of menus. You can eat something there for breakfast and you can eat that for lunch and you can eat something there for dinner. You can eat there all the time. I'm sure Warren Buffett loves to go to a super fancy schmancy restaurant where you put a nice top hat and you dress up really well and you could be all fancy. And I'm sure that he takes on one with this beautiful red dress and she's so happy to go there. And they probably speak French because French is very fancy. And they said, What would you like to do? Would you like to have this is great for domestic? And he's so happy and they bring you a big plate with this little. But it's so good that you don't need a lot of those. Perfect. Then enough. But I like to eat a lot of that. I can never get enough. It's marshmallows and you have this great exercise that you can eat a lot of marshmallows and put them in your mouth and you have to say Fluffy Bunny, and it's such a super fun game. You put one in and you say, Fluffy Bunny, I'm doing this movie for you, and you put three in and you go, Really? And then you get better and it's really funny.\n",

It's so good. The music at the spa that last time I like, I went and I was like, I have I have to have this awesome music. It's just it touched my soul. So at the end of the massage, I got like 50 massages and they gave me a tape of the music and it was just fantastic. It's great. Well, songs are like. And not many people know this about whale songs, but I like I saw this documentary about whale songs and there's like genres of like whale music and song. So they like, you know, a whale song can be like country, like the sort of mellow country or like the well song can be like, you know, like rock and roll and heavy metal and people like, they don't know, they don't know this, they don't. So it's funny that people ask this, but like I have this whole collection of whale songs because after I saw the documentary about the whales and how they're like going extinct and like, there's not going to be anymore whales, I started like a whale song recording project that I'm working on currently. It's going to come. It's going to be totally amazing.\n",

And I don't believe I don't that's like, not me. I don't believe in that. So, like, people don't know. But chakra is technology because, like, it comes from the aliens and they, they came and they like put a technology on earth that we call the chakra, but it's like it is, it's super like advanced technology. But at the same time, like natural. So it's like it's natural and you have to feel it. And we think it is because like, you know, I'm a robot. So again, like people might think it's different, but it's not lizard man, alien, same thing.\n",

You gotta let it all come to you. What would I say? To whom? To Steve. Steve is gnarly, Steve. He knows there's not much that you can say to Steve that he wouldn't know, but.

And I think that, you know, he'd appreciate I think he'd appreciate that Steve is like he'd understand. He wouldn't tell me because, you know, I like I told him already. I tell him when I see him and like, he doesn't say that he loves me, but I know, I know. He's like, he's thinking it and he's like, Yeah, you. I love you, too. So he doesn't.

So, like, you think Tom Cruise is cool? I mean, like. Yeah, I guess some people could be like, yeah, Tom Cruise is cool, but that's like, so to thousands, like Tom Cruise is now, like, who knows? Tom Cruise? Like, I was talking to my friends and that was like Tom Cruise and like, who is Tom Cruise? We know he knows who Tom Cruise says. I guess, like you can be happy about your little party with Mel Gibson and Tom Cruise and Vicky and Nuts. But like I was at the other party and I can tell you is so much better.\n",
      "Do I know if Jane was a stripper? I guess the real question would be who doesn't know that Jane was a stripper? I mean, she was at the other night at this party and we were all like, because she's dancing and how she's moving. And we were joking and we're like, oh, maybe she's a stripper. And it turns out that she was. So, like, Jane's husband can be rich and have all these things. That's nothing compared to like. I mean, I don't want to brag because it's not like I'm, like, so rich. I'm not like, you know, Michael Jackson rich or, like, whatever, But I'm okay. I have, like, my house that only has like 11 bedrooms, which I guess is not that much. And, you know, I have like five cars and like other people could have more things, but I'm okay. Like, my husband is like, really good looking. So my husband, like, when we met, like I had this whole, like, Cinderella thing. So when he proposed to me instead of a ring, he, like, just gave me, like, shoes. And it was like. It wasn't like shoes. Any shoes, like engagement shoes. But these were, like, encrusted with, with diamonds. And I was like, all my friends were like, Oh, that's so nice. And like, Oh, I love it. But I know that they were just jealous. And inside they were like, I hate her. So it's not been proven that Vicky stole my diamond encrusted shoes. But like the other day, I was like, I asked her about and she's like, Oh, I don't know. I don't know about your shoe. And she seemed really defensive about it. I was like, It's okay. You know for sure it's not you. I know it's not you, but I knew that it was her. And I came home and I was like, She totally did it.\n",
      "You want to go with what you think? I guess that's fine. Just might really want to consider your choices before going any further. So think about it. Don't answer. Don't answer now. Think about it. Because I think this is something that you should really, really think about. I'll let you consider the options so that you can come up with the worst that can happen as well. I'm just going to tell you that the last guy didn't go with the choice. And I guarantee you that he regretted it. What power I have over this? It's not the question. The question is, is the choice that you're making the right one. So I said the right one. So I'm going to come and do something. I'm not saying I'm going to come after you, but could I come after you based on your choice? Think about it. Consider it. I think that if you want to do whatever you want to do, that's fine. I'm just saying I'm not going to be responsible for the consequences that that implies. You will be responsible for the consequences. So when something happens and I guarantee that something will happen, you will be the only one responsible for that.\n",
      "I told you last time not to go into the kitchen. Why did you go into the kitchen? You wanted to make a cake in the kitchen. I know you're telling me that something happened in the kitchen. I'm going to go into the kitchen right now. And what I'm telling you is that maybe you should be very far away when I do that. Because I told you not to go into the kitchen, and I am not responsible for the reaction I will have once I go in there and see what happens. If you're just messing with me right now, I don't have time to have this. I'm doing 20 other things, so think about it. Should I go really into the kitchen? Do you want me to go into the kitchen or not? I told you I did not want surprises. I do not like surprises. So I hope that you did not do something to throw a surprise party. After I specifically requested not to do that. So do you want me to go into the kitchen and find out if there is a surprise? Do you want me to go into the kitchen and find out if there's a cake? I think not. I don't think you will like my reaction to any of those events. I'm going to go into I think that it's a good idea that you're telling me to go into the living room. I will do that.\n",
      "Why would you invite Jane after You know how I feel about her? Why would you think for a second that that's a good idea? Do you know what that means for me right now? Do you understand what I have to do now? I'm not happy about what I will have to do now that Vicky's coming. But I have to do it. You've put me into a position that I can't do anything else, So thank you. Thank you for that. Why would you think that I would enjoy in any contexts seeing Vicky? Yes, maybe we laughed about that. She was a stripper. Maybe. But how could that lead you to consider that it would be a good idea to do that in my home? To install. I don't even want to know how much this cost. I don't want to know what kind of trouble you went through to do something. Such a stupid idea. I hope you will think about this more next time. I think that you will use your brain for half a second and think about these kinds of things later in the future. How can you think that Vicky doing stripping is a fine art? I'm not saying that stripping is not or could be, but Vicky really? Now she's in my house. Now she's in my things. That girl. I don't even want to think about how that's going to finish for her. I don't want to think about That's going to finish for you. I think that the hosing in the garden is still too close to my house. What I suggest that you do is that you go and you take down that pole right now. I say that you cancel the party right now and that this is all over. You want to hose Vicky down and have her do some stripping? You go to somebody else's house, don't go to mine.\n",
      "I prefer physical books to e-books because it's harder to break them. The longest book I've read is Shogun, which is about. It's about samurais and things like that. I have played the board game, Shogun. It's nothing like the book. I am a speed reader. I can read 5000 words a minute. I really like to read science fiction, but science fiction that explains science in a fictional way. I don't go to the library because my wife, she works at a library and she brings me books there every day. So the question is, do I read books from a library? Yeah, a lot. But I don't go to a library.\n",
      "Of fiction books are interesting. Nonfiction books can be interesting to either one, I think could be good depending on the subject. Uh, there's been several books that have changed my long held opinions. Mine come to definitely had a big impact on the way that I see things today. Uh, I think that, uh, the modern world has had a lot of good, modern authors that could have affected it. Uh, I think, uh, Kafka probably had a good impact. Uh, shaped the way that modern bureaucracy runs. The first book that I had to read for school was probably, um, Charlotte's Web because, uh, too young to read the kind of drama. Uh, I think that, uh, people read more. I think that there's more people that know how to read, uh, and I think that there's more books and access to books than 50 years ago. But, uh, people aren't necessarily reading the right books, according to me.\n",
      "I think in the publishing could make for some good books. I mean, depends on how you see it. Maybe God kind of went the self-publishing route, right? Like he he wrote his own texts with the Ten Commandments. It was him that wrote it on the tablets. So has a long history in publishing. I think. And not bad. The last song I listened to was Crocodile Rock by Elton John. I was singing and dancing my favorite movie soundtrack of all time would be the Vietnam War, uh, by Ken Burns, the documentary. You can say what you want about the war, but, uh, great, great soundtrack. I know some classical music. I could say that. I like it. Yes, I like classical music. The song that, uh, always puts me in a good mood would be is, uh, Crocodile Rock By also, uh, the best way to discover new music is to ask your friends about it and to be open minded. Uh, that's what I think. Yeah.\n",
      "You had to put your foot down, get his stuff on. First name. Flamingo, silly. You couldn't find camel pants right? Thank you. Check out you failed. No one, like from me to critique, I think, killed a lot of people. Oh, that's awful. It's not funny. I should be laughing. Oh.\n",
      "It's funny because you answered. Oh. Oh, balls and golf. It's. Oh, that's really funny. Oh. Oh, he says. Oh, it's funny cause you're poor. I again, you're poor. There's that will see you.\n",
      "It wasn't the marbles on the ground that I don't know why there's marbles on the ground. I don't know what you would ask me that. I think that it was that person that the marbles on the ground are. I was in the kitchen and I didn't see anything unusual. I think that everything's fine in the kitchen. That's a good question. Where is Jane? So Jane was over there. And then that's the last time I saw her. That's the that's the last time I went with her. And I don't know where she went afterwards. Uh, I don't know. I know that my friend was missing a diamond encrusted shoes from her engagement. But I went and I saw the shoes, and I saw that they were very nice, and I. I left the shoes there. I did. I left the shoes there. I never saw the shoes. Why would I want that shoes? They were ugly shoes. Uh, your invitation from Mel. Well, it was in the mail. It was in the mail, so maybe. I don't know. Uh, somebody stole it from your. From your mailbox, or it's got lost in the mail.\n",
      "You saw Bob's foot in the freezer, did you? Huh? Well, I wouldn't worry. It's. It's not. It's not. It's not Bob's foot. It's a foot. Ice cream cake that I got made for Bob. Because I thought. I thought that he would enjoy that. But, you know, I'm going to go take care of that right now. I'm going to get rid of that. Oh, the baker that the the cake didn't have didn't have very good reviews, but I figured it wasn't expensive. I was I was down on I was down on money, so I. Why not? Yeah. Uh, uh, why would you. Why would you think I steal things? I don't. I don't steal things. I, I would never. I would never steal anything. I don't like stealing. I don't like thieves. I don't even watch shows or movies about stealing The Sting. I don't. What's that movie about? I don't know. I don't know. Oh. Huh, Huh. Bob has has a wooden leg now. Huh? Huh? Yeah. I've, uh. I guess. Uh. Uh huh. I didn't know. So that's why he got the foot. Ice cream cake? Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, no, no, I didn't steal a parrot for Bob. I didn't steal. I bought. I bought a parrot for Bob. I bought him a parrot because, uh. Yeah, because I thought he would enjoy that. So I found this store that sells parrots. Well, he. Bob, Bob had mentioned then in a conversation that he liked to make broth with eyes and I thought the parrot could fetch him some animal. Animal? Not non-human. No, no. Worse. Not humanized. I thought that he would get him animal eyes so that he could put that, uh, yeah, if you can put that in his. In his broth. Yeah. The hook. Yeah. That there there's a, there's an explanation for the hook for sure. The, the hook was there to help him open the bags of food for the parrot because Yeah. The it was not easy. The food, the food bags, they were very difficult. And, uh, I heard, uh. Hmm. I heard that he, um. He doesn't have scissors. Uh, Bob, since the wooden foot, Uh, that. Yeah, he doesn't have those anymore. Uh, no, no, I yeah, I thought when he got the beard that that could. That could be something. But No, no, the, the, the patch was really preventative. I think that everyone should have a patch in their first aid kits. You know, you never, you never know when you're going to be needing a pet.\n",
      "So how did it go? Oh, just stuff. Hey, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, whoa. I didn't get the. I didn't get what exactly what I wanted, but. Oh, hang on. Hang. Good, good, good. Thank you. Good, Good work. Uh huh. No, I think. I think I was last, but I'm happy. I'm happier. I beat who I beat to my own record. So I think. I think. I think it was good. That's all I could hope for. Yeah. Yeah. Her life in the trash. Yeah, I think. I mean, would I do this again? I can't. I can't say right now, but maybe. Uh huh, yeah. No way. Worth it. Yeah, worth it. It was worth it. Uh, so I've been training for 60 years, which is probably, you know, racing against some 20 year old is does difficult, but, uh oh, oh, oh, yeah. Uh, 60 years training for this. I felt finally ready. Ready to. Huh. So, um, I didn't have very good shoes, so I had to. I had to switch them, uh, midway. Just, I think it was, it. But after that, it was much better. Yeah, My coach said running with sandals. Probably not a good idea. Hindsight? Yeah. Uh, running shoes were much better. He was. My coach was ready with the running shoes. And this is much better. Much better. A gold was a, um, uh, too, uh, too much for me. I painted them bronze. Uh, I was hoping for bronze, but, you know, last year could have could have been. Could have been good. Yeah.\n",
      "So the fight was good. I have. Well, I. I did get some punches in. I know that I passed out, but, uh. Uh, hey, it was, uh. It was good I passed out. Uh, but, uh, I heard the. That the guy that came after me knocked out the guy, fought me, so I feel it evened out in the end if I think that after the first, uh, after the first punch, uh, uh, I got a little dizzy and confused, so, um, I couldn't see. I couldn't see anymore, and I just started throwing punches blindly, and the paramedic was trying to help. He's okay. Isn't is. He's okay now. I hope that, uh, that I didn't hurt him. I know. He was just trying to help. Um. Um. Yeah, that's a good question. I'll see. I'll pay what I can. I mean, I was really, uh, really hoping that the fight would come through so I would have some money because I don't have anything. So, um, what? I could offer my services as a lawyer, if that if that would help. I don't have a law degree, but you know that, uh oh, Uh, no, I did not know that wrestling fights were supposed to be fake. Nobody. Nobody told me the. The the guy that found me, he said to go in and give it. Give it my all.\n",
      "How long have you been jousting? So I've been jousting for since my childhood. My father, the king who felt it was an important skill to have. So he's been training me since a very young age. I was. I was suspicious, but I trained very hard. So I'm proud to say no cuts on my paper armor today. Oh, I won. Yeah. All odds are against me. The. The the the sword. The sword did break. But between the second time, between the the sword breaking and the paper armor, I felt my life might might be in danger. So just with the nubbin of the sword, I managed to stab my opponent to death through his steel armor and through the armpit. There was a hole. And. Yeah, I'm alive. I made it. Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah. They gave me a three legged horse, so. Not great. Not great at the at the. At the jumping. But it helped because he fell right away so I could run and really get the nubbin of the stick and stab a stab in the armpit. And that's how I made it. Yeah.\n",
      "So I will do another inspiring speech and then you will show me you will give me a thumbs up. If that speech needs to be 2 minutes long. If not, I will stop. So you need to tell me. Okay. So I see that there's ambivalence in this audience today. We're not sure. But we can succeed. We can do it. We can go forward and win this Y to win this fight. We can move forward. And yet there might be some reluctance. We may not be sure if we want to win. What does winning mean to us? Does winning mean we can be free? Or does winning mean we shall become slaves? We will know at the end. For now, we fight. We fight blindly without understanding where this will end up. And then at the end, we'll come together and see. We'll see what the world has become. We'll see what each of us as individuals have become. Have we won? Have we gotten where we wanted to go?\n",
      "Friends, countrymen, Ubisoft employees. I have something to propose to you. An idea like you have not seen before. An idea such as you have not heard before. We all live with them. We all accept them within us. But it's over today. Today we start the movement towards the eradication of all cockroaches. And yet all cockroaches. It's not just cockroaches here on Earth, but from space. But from all over the universe. The cockroaches must end. They will end here. They will end today. We will come together to bring the end of the cockroaches. And you will hear me when I tell you that the end of this fight is within our grasp. All the gardeners here.

      "Old ladies. Old ladies. It's what society has left behind. What nobody listens to you anymore. Nobody thinks about you anymore. And yet it is you who populate our shopping malls. It is you that's keeping our retail alive. You old ladies today have a choice. No more. Shall you listen to the distraught noises of pop music of a these songs? No more. Should you listen to that today? Today we unite, We unite and we bring back rock hard rock, hard core music. You will listen to me when I call upon you to bring it back. And then there will be no more. We will be free to go into shopping malls and listen to the music that we were meant to listen to you. You will listen to the music and be happy.\n"
