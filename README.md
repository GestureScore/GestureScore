# GestureScore

GestureScore

This directory provides the scripts for quantitative evaluation of our gesture generation framework. We currently support the following measures:

- Average Jerk and Acceleration (AJ)
- Histogram of Moving Distance (HMD) for velocity and acceleration
- Hellinger distance between histograms
- Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) coefficient
- Fréchet Gesture Distance (FGD)

## Average Jerk and Acceleration (AJ)

```bash
calk_jerk_or_acceleration.py
```

## Histogram of Moving Distance (HMD) for velocity and acceleration

```bash
calc_histogram.py
```

## Hellinger distance between histograms

```bash
hellinger_distance.py
```

## Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) coefficient

```bash
calc_cca.py
```

## Fréchet Gesture Distance (FGD)

```bash
calc_fgd.py
```
